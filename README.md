Algorithm Exercise: Array Shuffle 
========

This is a scala-based solution to a friend's problem set for their Algorithms class. Done just for the heck of it. 

The tests are written with scalatest. 

#### The Problem ####

![Given an array of 2n elements a1, a2, ..., an, b1, b2, ..., bn.
Give an algorithm to shuffle the array in place (without using more than O(1) space) into
a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., an, bn. Demonstrate your algorithm is correct and analyze the time complexity
of the algorithm.](problem.png)
